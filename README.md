## Overview
The Diabetes Prediction System is built using machine learning algorithms to provide predictions about the presence of diabetes in an individual. The system uses a dataset of relevant features and labels to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, which is then used to make predictions on new, unseen data.



## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were used in this project:

numpy: For numerical computations and array manipulation.
pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms, preprocessing, and evaluation.



## Data
The system uses the diabetes.csv file as input data for prediction. This file contains the necessary features required for making predictions. Make sure your data follows the same format.




## Model
The model used for prediction is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The SVM algorithm has been chosen for its ability to handle classification tasks and its effectiveness in capturing complex relationships in data.



## Evaluation
The accuracy of the model is evaluated using the accuracy_score metric from the scikit-learn library. This metric measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.
